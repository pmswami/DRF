api_view is python decorator which converts your python functions into an API View. It modifies function behaviour so that it can handle all the APi responses Views.
Serializers =>
    Serializers are used to convert complex data types, such as Django model instances, into Python data types that can be easily rendered into JSON, XML, or other content types.
    Serializers also provide deserialization, allowing parsed data to be converted back into complex types after first validating the incoming data.
    Serializers in Django are a part of the Django REST framework, a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.
    The two major serializers that are most popularly used are ModelSerializer and HyperLinkedModelSerialzer.
    Serializers provide validate() method for validating inputs.
    Serializers provide serializers.SerializerMethodField() method field to define custom fields.
    serializers.Serializer ise used to write custom serializer with custom validations without model being used/attched.

APIView =>
    Using the APIView class is pretty much the same as using a regular View class, as usual, the incoming request is dispatched to an appropriate handler method such as .get() or .post()
    Handler methods may return REST framework's Response
    class based View

Status Codes =>
     REST framework includes a set of named constants that you can use to make your code more obvious and readable.
     from rest_framework import status

Authentication =>
    https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/
    Basic Authentication in Django REST Framework uses HTTP Basic Authentication.
    The REST framework will attempt to authenticate the Basic Authentication class and set the returned values to request.user and request.auth. If successfully authenticated, BasicAuthentication provides the following credentials.

    request.user will be a Django User instance.
    request.auth will be None.

    if not, the value of request.user will be set to as an instance of django.contrib.auth.models.AnonymousUser, and request.auth will be set to None.
