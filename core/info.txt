Serializers =>
    Serializers are used to convert complex data types, such as Django model instances, into Python data types that can be easily rendered into JSON, XML, or other content types.
    Serializers also provide deserialization, allowing parsed data to be converted back into complex types after first validating the incoming data.
    Serializers in Django are a part of the Django REST framework, a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.
    The two major serializers that are most popularly used are ModelSerializer and HyperLinkedModelSerialzer.
    Serializers provide validate() method for validating inputs.
    Serializers provide serializers.SerializerMethodField() method field to define custom fields.
    serializers.Serializer ise used to write custom serializer with custom validations without model being used/attched.
